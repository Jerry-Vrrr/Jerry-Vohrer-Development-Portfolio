        <p>I single-handedly developed a bespoke Point of Sale, inventory, and appointment scheduling application tailored specifically for a client, utilizing Ruby on Rails with a dash of Bootstrap for that chic styling. This was completed in about 150 hours over a 6 week period. Now, a little confession... 'Eelvis' isn't the real name of the company; I coined it to shield the true identity. Also, I couldn't resist the charm of picturing Eelvis takin care of business, making all the guppies swoon. Kindly note, this application is currently in its... Beta phase... Yes, pun intended!.</p>
